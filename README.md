# TinyLootMonitor
A simple yet efficient loot monitor.

## How does it work?
Every time you or someone in your group loot an item, a toast will appear showing the loot, the player who looted it and the name of the item.

## What can you setup?

- The minimum quality **TLM** will track;
- Maximum number of toasts on screen;
- The time the toasts will stay on screen;
- The sound the toast will play when popped-up;
- The anchor's place where the toasts will appear;
- If **TLM** will fire only to equippable items;
- A ban list. Items added to it won't fire **TLM**.

You can open the config meny by typing `/tlm` or opening the Interface menu.

Settings are saved in profiles, so you can set it up per character if you wish.

## Translation needed!

If you want to translate a few strings, send me a message after you're done! Curse doesn't tell me when someone translates the addon. And thank you for your support!

## I've found a bug!

Although **TLM** is flagged as release, some nasty bugs might still lurk around. If you found something, send me the error here in the comments. Thanks!
